# Creating Pipeline
**TO DO** :
- [ ] Web Dev Part
  - [ ] _Basic_ (**Templates, and Technology to be used**)
    1. Front-end (<code> HTML </code>)
    2. Front-end (<code> CSS </code>)
    3. Front-end (<code> JS  </code>)
    4. Flask for model deployment and Back-end(<code> Flask </code>)
    5. Hosting the web app.
    
  - [ ] _Page Structure_ (**3 pages to be designed**)
    1. Landing Page (Description about the application)
    2. Forms Page (Inputting the data)
    3. Result and data analysis (Predicted results, and real time analysis of data)
    
- [ ] Data Science Part
  - [ ] _Basic_ (**Model, and Technology/Algorithms to be used**)
    1. Python (<code>IDE to be used Spyder/Pycharm </code>)
    2. Regression 
    3. Decision Tree Regressor 
    4. Random Forest Regressor
    5. To be discussed
    
# Challenges anticipated
- [ ] Web Dev Part
    1. Deploying the model using Flask
    2. Creating real time data analysis 
    3. Using API
- [x] Data Science Part
    1. Imputing the data according to what data we need (for eg. ,If student doesn't have compensation it's assigned NA, but is a important data)
    2. Eliminating the non-useful parameters, (manual or using correlation)
    3. Creating Categories
    4. Handling huge amount of data on Local Machine
- [ ] Model Deployment
- [ ] To be added
